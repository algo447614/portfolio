NotesApp

NotesApp is a Python-based note-taking application inspired by the Cornell note-taking system. It uses the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and allows users to organize their notes by course, chapter, and paragraph. Notes can be created, viewed, and edited through an intuitive interface, and all notes are saved to the local file system.

    Course Management: Create and load course folders to organize notes.
    Note Organization: Notes are organized by chapters and paragraphs, making it easy to navigate and edit notes.
    View All Notes: View all notes within a course in a single window.
    Continue Notes: Easily continue notes from the highest chapter and paragraph.
    Next Chapter/Paragraph: Quickly create notes for the next chapter or paragraph.
    Save Notes: Save notes directly to the appropriate course and chapter.
